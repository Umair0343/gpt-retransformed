# gpt-retransformed
I am creating an open source project for everyone to participate in it and that everyone can benefit from it. The project is simple we want to enhance the custom OpenAI's GPT model. We can add multiple new features in this web app for example translate languages etc. Use your creativity to bring your ideas to life.

Project Name: Come up with a catchy name for your project that reflects its purpose and inclusivity. Something like "GPT+ Community Edition" or "OpenGPT Enhancer" could work well.
Collaborative Platform: Choose a platform for collaboration, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. These platforms provide version control, issue tracking, and collaboration tools essential for managing an open-source project.
Feature Roadmap: Create a roadmap outlining the planned features and enhancements for the project. This roadmap can be shared with the community to gather feedback and attract contributors.
