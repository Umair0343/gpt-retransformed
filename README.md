This project is a Flask-based web application that leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo models to perform various natural language processing tasks. Users can interact with the application through a web interface, where they can select a model, provide a prompt, and choose an operation (like sentiment analysis, text classification, translation, summarization, or text completion).

Key Features:

Model Selection: Users can choose from a list of available GPT-3.5-turbo models.
Prompt Input: Users can input custom prompts for the selected model.
Operation Selection: Users can specify the desired operation for the prompt.
Dynamic Response Rendering: The application calls the OpenAI API with the provided inputs and displays the generated response on a results page.
Multiple Endpoints: The app includes several routes to handle different types of requests and render the corresponding templates.
The app includes the following endpoints:

/results: Handles GET requests to process user input and display the generated response.
/results_new: Similar to /results, but includes the additional functionality to specify an operation for the prompt.
/: The main index page.
/prompt_design: A page where users can design their prompts.
/specific_tasks: A page focused on specific tasks like sentiment analysis or translation.

To run the application, ensure you have Flask and OpenAI installed, set up your OpenAI API key, and execute the script. The app will be accessible locally, allowing you to experiment with different prompts and operations using GPT-3.5-turbo models.
